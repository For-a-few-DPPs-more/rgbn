"""
Public API.

`blue.sample_points` is the main entry point of the package.
It provides a high-level interface for generating large point sets on the
periodic unit hypercube [0, 1)^D with sub-Poisson density fluctuations
(so-called blue noise).

The package also exposes utilities to sample tessellations (2D only) and
balanced clusters (arbitrary dimension).
Tessels or clusters are sampled with the following balance property:
uniform area repartition if no target is given, or uniform atom repartition
if target atoms are given.

Clusters and tessellations can subsequently be converted into low-discrepancy
point sets using `tessel2points` / `cluster2points`, which internally solve a
moment-matching problem.

        experimental for D≥6.
    lr : float, default 1.0
        Global learning-rate multiplier applied to all internal step sizes.
        Values above 1.0 converge faster but may overshoot and produce
        less uniform patterns. Values below 1.0 slow convergence but can
        improve final quality. The default of 1.0 works well in most cases;
        only tune this if you have a specific speed/quality trade-off in mind.
    method : {"rgbn", "nufft", "bruteforce"}, default "rgbn"
        Sampling algorithm:

        - ``"rgbn"``       — Recursive Gaussian Blue-Noise. Spatial loss,
          truncated neighbourhood. Linear complexity, recommended for most uses.
        - ``"nufft"``      — Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform. Spectral loss.
          Good alternative for 2D; does **not** support a ``targets`` density.
        - ``"bruteforce"`` — Exact GBN with no truncation. Best quality but
          O(N²) cost. Automatically selected when N ≤ 2 000.
    warmstart : {None, "Sobol", "Pinwheel", ndarray of shape (N, D)}, default None
        Initial point configuration before optimisation:

        - ``None``        — default random / recursive initialisation.
        - ``"Sobol"``     — initialise with a Sobol low-discrepancy sequence
          (requires ``scipy``). Recommended when N is a power of 2.
        - ``"Pinwheel"``  — initialise with a pinwheel aperiodic tiling
          (2D only). Falls back to Sobol for D > 2.
        - ndarray         — use the provided array as the starting configuration.
    n_iter : int, default 6
        Number of solver iterations. Each iteration runs 10 gradient steps
        plus one structural gridification step (neighbour lookup).
        More iterations yield better quality at the cost of runtime.
    targets : ndarray of shape (K, D) or str, optional
        Atoms describing a target density for adaptive sampling.
        Can also be a path to an image file, e.g. ``targets="zebra.jpg"``.
        Not supported with ``method="nufft"``.
    verbose : int, default 1
        Verbosity level: ``0`` = silent, ``1`` = live progress bar with ETA.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int, default 32768
        Number of output quadrilaterals. **Must be a power of 2.**

        - shape ``(2,)``    — one point projected onto every triangle.
        - shape ``(M, 2)``  — M points projected onto every triangle.
        - shape ``(N, M, 2)`` — each set of M points mapped to its own triangle.
    depth : int, default 4
        Number of subdivision iterations. The number of triangles grows as
        ``4 × 5^depth``.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray of shape (T, M, 2)
        Transformed points for each of the T triangles at the given depth.
        T = 4 × 5^depth.

    Notes
    -----
    The Pinwheel tiling is non-periodic: each triangle is subdivided into 5
    smaller triangles, each rotated by arctan(1/2) relative to its parent.
    All orientations are dense on the circle, making the tiling isotropic.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> pw0 = blue.pinwheel_base()          # (3, 2) base triangle
    >>> pts = blue.tessel2points(pw0)       # (3, 3, 2) — 3 points per sub-region
    >>> tiling = blue.pinwheel_transform(pts, depth=4)  # (T, 3, 2)
    >>> flat = tiling.reshape(-1, 2)        # flatten to a point set
