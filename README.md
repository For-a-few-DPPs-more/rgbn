# blue-sampler

**Generate large stealthy point patterns** on the unit torus $[0, 1)^D$. 📐

Stealthy point patterns exhibit vanishing density fluctuations at low frequencies, making them particularly suited for **Monte Carlo** integration, **image stippling**, and any application requiring well-distributed, low-discrepancy points. 

The main blue-noise samplers (**RGBN** and **NUFFT**) offer **linear** complexity in the number of points.  
They can generate e.g. 1 million 2D (resp 3D) points in under 10 minutes (resp 30 minutes) on a standard CPU, and up to 30× faster on GPU (30s resp 1 minute). 

> **Note**: The sampling methods implemented here support adaptive sampling from a target distribution. This feature is still experimental beyond 2d distributions

# Positioning and scope

One can find extensive Blue-noise and hyperuniform sampling methods in the literature, all involving different trade-offs between spectral quality, computational cost, dimensionality, hardware requirements, implementation complexity, and support for adaptive sampling. To briefly cite some of them: **Perturbed lattices** are simple and fast; **Poisson-disk** is a mature and popular tool; **Void-and-Cluster masks** offer instant execution but are restricted to regular grids; **Relaxation methods** (such as Lloyd or CCVT) are classic but slow to converge and prone to structural artifacts; **Optimal Transport** (BNOT) provides natural adaptive sampling but is computationally heavy; **Gaussian blue noise** (GBN) achieves ultra-high spatial quality but has quadratic complexity; and **Fast reciprocal space Correlator** (FReSCo) combines ultra-high quality with near-linear complexity, though it requires installing heavy external dependencies or familiarity with docker containers.

blue-sampler is not intended as a universal replacement for these methods. It is a lightweight Python framework for experiments on blue noise and hyperuniformity, targeting simple installation (native Python code) and device flexibility (CPU/GPU), high spectral quality (achieving the commonly accepted "stealthy" criterions $S(k) \lesssim 10^{-3} - 10^{-4}$), adaptive sampling, and support for 3D and higher dimensions.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install blue-sampler
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
import blue_sampler as blue

# Generate 10,000 2D blue-noise points
x = blue.sample_points(N=10_000, D=2)
blue.plot(x) 

# Structure factor
blue.plot_structure_factor(x) 

# Image stippling
x = blue.im2points("plots/zebra.jpg") #return points
x = blue.im2quads("plots/vangogh.jpg")   #quadrilaterals
```

## 📋 Available Samplers

### Main sampling methods

```python
x = blue.sample_points(N, D, method="rgbn") #(N, D)
```

| Method         | Description                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `bruteforce`   | original Gaussian-Blue-Noise sampler (high quality, slow), A. G. M. Ahmed, J. Ren, and P. Wonka.  |
| `rgbn`         | Recursive Gaussian-Blue-Noise (speed-up GBN with robust approximations)      |
| `nufft`        | Non-Uniform FFT (speed-up spectral methods with fast fourier transform)    |
| `cheap`        | fast and simple lattice jittering        |

## Alternative Samplers

### Sobol sequence 📏

```python
x = blue.sobol(N, D) #(N, D)
```
Low-discrepancy quasi-random sequence. 

### Clusters

```python
# Raw clusters
cl = blue.sample_clusters(N, D) #(N, K, D)
blue.plot_clusters(cl) 

# Convert to point set
x = blue.cluster2points(cl) #(N, m, D)
```

### STIT Tessellations (2D only) 🧩

```python
# Raw STIT tessellation (quadrilaterals)
ts = blue.sample_tessels(N) #(N, 4, D=2)
blue.plot_tessels(ts) 

# Convert to point set
x = blue.tessel2points(ts) #(N, m, D=2)
```

### Pinwheel Tilings (2D only) 𖣘

```python
# Base pinwheel triangle
pw0 = blue.pinwheel_base()  #(3, D=2)

# Triangulation level 4
pw4 = blue.pinwheel_transform(pw0, depth=4) #(4*5**depth, 3, D=2)
blue.plot_polygons(pw4) 

#===============================
# Convert Pinwheel to point set:
#===============================
#sample points from the BASE pinwheel
x0 = blue.tessel2points(pw0) #(m, D=2)
#then replicate the sample on the full triangulation,
#in a fractal way
x4 = blue.pinwheel_transform(x0, depth = 4) #(4*5**depth, m, D=2)
```

> **Note**: The conversion from geometric objects (polygons or clusters) to point sets is performed using a standard **moment matching** technique. cluster2points(x, p = 3) and tessel2points(x, p = 3) will sample m points per batch that mimic the statistical {0, 1, ... p-1} moments of the batch.
